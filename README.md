# FLIP Fluids

This repository hosts builds of the FLIP Fluids addon for Blender. The builds were generated by following the [Dodslaser tutorial](https://blog.dodslaser.se/Building-and-Installing-the-Blender-FLIP-Fluids-Addon-from-Source/), and you can download them from the releases page above.

This release doesn't include the material presets from the Blender Market version, as those assets are not free to redistribute. If you want them, you'll need to purchase a copy (and support ongoing development!).

The source code in the official repository is rarely updated, so this build is quite outdated compared to the Blender Market version. You can see what changes have been made on [the Blender Market page](https://www.blendermarket.com/products/flipfluids) under the Change Log section.
